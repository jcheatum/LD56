## Description

Get ready for a picnic party like no other in "Bug Bash"!

You're the proud owner of a delicious spread, but those pesky bugs have other plans! They're crawling all over your blanket, eyeing up your snacks with their beady little eyes. It's time to defend your feast and show these six-legged thieves who's boss.

Armed with an arsenal of wacky weapons, you'll need to outsmart (and out-bug) the unwanted guests. Sugar cubes can temporarily block their path, while bug spray will give them a nasty case of... well, bugs! A lighter might just set things ablaze (literally!), and a trusty fly swatter is always at your disposal.

But wait – there's more! The real game-changers are the magnifying glass and mirrors. Use these to harness the power of the sun and blast those bugs into oblivion.

As the picnic chaos unfolds, upgrade your defenses to take down even the most determined critters. Will you emerge victorious, or will those pesky insects devour everything in sight? There's only one way to find out – join the Bug Bash and get ready for a bug-tastic battle!
